User Registration and Login System
This is a basic PHP project that implements a user registration and login system. It includes:

Registration: Users can create an account with a username, email, and hashed password.
Login: Users can log in using their credentials.
Session Management: Keeps users logged in until they log out.
Logout: Ends the user session and redirects to the login page.
